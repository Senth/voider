Human-readable terms summary
----------------------------
To protect ourselves from legal trouble. Everything you create in Voider is owned by Spiddekauga Games, but you yourself are liable for creating levels, enemies, and bullets that conform to our terms. I.e. don't use copyrighted materials and or create hate against other people. Use common-sense :) You also agree that any other person can create a copy of your creations and modify them freely, the original creator still gets credit for them though.

You agree that anonymous statistics are logged and sent to the server. This information is used for a) Bug reports, it's around 2-20 times easier to find bugs using this. I.e. fixes will be out much faster :) b) Checking how long people stay on specific screens and if they have trouble finding what they want, i.e. improving the system for you and c) Random statistics are just fun.

During or after the beta all levels might be cleared, i.e. your account will be reset. You agree that this is OK.
