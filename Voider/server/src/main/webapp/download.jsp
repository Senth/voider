            <p>Follow the instructions below to install the Beta</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">Download Java</a>. At the moment you
                    need to download and install Java manually to play the game
                </li>
                <li><a href="http://storage.googleapis.com/voider-shared/app/Voider-beta.jar">Download
                    Desktop version</a>
                </li>
                <li>Download Android version. (Coming Soon!)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It's easiest to create levels on the computer and the game is made to be played on
                the phone. In the future an installation package will be released for desktops, and
                you won't need to install Java manually.</p>

            <p>You have installed Voider, what do you do now? My advice to you is to</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Play some levels. Start with <em>Level 1</em></li>
                <li>Create your own level by watching the tutorial below</li>
                <li>Publish your level when it's done :D</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The best levels (according to the community) will be available with the release of
                the game. If you are the creator of such a level you will get the full game for free
                once it is released. :)</p>
